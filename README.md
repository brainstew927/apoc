this is a simple program written in python to download the chosen pic of the day by NASA, using NASA APOC API
## what is contained in the project?
in this project there is a GUI application which can be used to see and save the picture on your pc
## how can i run the program?
you'll need:
- python (i'm using python 3.9)
you can install all the required library by calling pip install -r requirements.txt when inside of the 
project directory. 
you should use virtual enviroment but it isn't necessary.
you need to put your NASA api key (that can be requested [here](https://api.nasa.gov)) in a file which needs to be
called key, in the root directory of the project. 
you can then run the main.py file.
in the future a startup and an install script will be provided.
